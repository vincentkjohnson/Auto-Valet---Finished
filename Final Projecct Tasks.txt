Tasks for Final Project:

1) Driving Bot (Autonomously)
- Calibration of Sensors
- Bumping Sensors
	- Low Objects
- Cliff Sensors
	- White Line
	- Hole in the course
	- End Area?
2) Scanning Area
- Ping Sensor
	- Obstacle Distance
- IR Sensor
	- Location of Obstacles
3) GUI
- UART
- Wifi to Putty


Flowchart:
Start in Area -> Scan 180 degree arc -> Locate objects
-> If objects are to far, move forward in increments -> Scan 180 degree arc
-> Locate Objects
